# CloudAuthN

CloudAuthN is a Go-based command line tool designed to retrieve AWS credentials by authenticating through an Identity Provider (IdP) Single Sign-On (SSO). Currently, only Microsoft IdP and AWS are supported, but the tool is designed with extensibility in mind for future cloud providers and IdPs.

## Features

- **AWS Credential Retrieval**: Automatically fetch all AWS credentials for which the user has been granted access, after successful authentication.
- **Microsoft SSO Authentication**: Authenticate using Microsoft as the Identity Provider (IdP) via SSO.
- **Command Line Interface**: Simple and efficient CLI interface built using Golang.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.20+**: Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.
- This tool currently authenticates via Microsoft SSO to Authenticate against AWS via SAML. This means you will need to configure the following environment variables as follows:
  - `CLOUDAUTHN_MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` â€” This is the Microsoft Azure Tenant which is used to authenticate your corporation or organisation's users. This ID can be found in the login URL `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}`
